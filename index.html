            <p class="poem">On a fine day in some country, a normal looking gentleman stops at a large city intersection. He looks around for a second and yells "Dear spectators, come closer! Don't be shy!" Heads turn, some people come closer. "Hi there!" The man looks around and smiles. "Good people of this here city, in my one hand I have everything we have already structured and understood." "I am talking about knowledge of course!" The surrounding crowd nods confidently. Some kids laugh. "A lot isn't it!" The man opens his hand and as predicted, it is filled with everything the crowd knows and is familiar with. Most people do however see places they have never been to or difficult math problems and their answers. The man looks around again and says: "But in my other hand I have everything we will never understand with this simple brain of ours!" The man yells madly: "And never will!" The crowd gazes at the other hand, people shuffle and go out of their way to see what's going on. The man finally opens his hand, but unfortunately, it is empty.</p>

            <p class="poem-title">Thoughts of an idiot</p>
            <p class="poem">If a thing (all but nothing) is what it is, then it cannot be spoken of. It can be neither uttered, nor translated.
            <p class="poem">If an individual is who he is, which he is, then he cannot be talked about like he is a changing individual. Many aspects are inherent to his being. All of the aspects which are inherent can not be talked about. Ever only orbiting, spinning around its true being.</p>
            <p class="poem">If an individual is who he is, which he is, then he is fixed, unmovable by the spoken word or by writing. He is, however, ever-changing of course. But only in thought, never in language. Why? Because language is binary. We created language transcendentally of course, but never did we stop to think it created us too.</p>

            <p class="poem-title">Martin Heidegger and Terrence Malick</p>
            <p class="poem">A piece I found on a site, searching for Heidegger's cinema:</p>
            <p class="poem"><em>"If realism, as stated, is replication of reality, then reality, as Malick sees it, cannot be captured in terms of what are statically present in an unrelated, isolated manner, waiting to be perceived by subjects. It is suggestive that Heidegger, one of Malick's formative influences, claims reality in any sense should be thought of in terms of emergence and withdrawal, after the Presocratics, rather than static presence. As a certain aspect appears, certain other aspects retreat into the background (or more exactly, in order for a certain aspect to appear, certain other aspects must retreat into the background, as with the Necker cube or duck-rabbit picture.) Heidegger even believes that the understanding of reality as wholly available for mastery is responsible for, among other things, the modern ecological crisis."</em></p>

            <p class="poem-title">The mind of the constructed man</p>
            <p class="poem">The mind of the constructed man is built like a bridge. One might say his mind works constructively and progressively. He is very successful in being wholesome and being a certain way. But he also has no clue of what things are made of in essence. In fact, that question is very hard, and it does not concern him.</p>
            <p class="poem">The mind of the deconstructed man is built like a virus. Maybe one that destroys everything and then itself. He might have Alzheimer, I'm not sure. This man has no intention of building anything. In fact, if he tries, he fails hard. But despite him being completely obsolete in this constructed world he lives in, he is actually good at one thing. This one thing makes him in my opinion more valuable than anyone else. In unwillingly deconstructing his mind, he deconstructs the world around him as well. This can be very difficult. Every building, every picture, every idea, every story, every theory, every letter of every word he takes apart. Not with a purpose in mind, no, that blessing would be for the constructed man. And yet he does it.</p>
